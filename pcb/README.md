three revisions of PCB currently

H - first pcb ever, works and is tested, needs external temperature circuit for transmission and engine temps
I - second revision TH, very similar with H but now with internal temperature circuit
J - did not pass testing, not included.
K - first SMD revision, tested working and one that I currently use when driving.

firmware is compatible for all revisions, things to be noted is that revH has small output wire holes, which can be bit difficult.
and n2/n3rpm resistor in series should be removed and replaced with wire on all revisions.
I like to use 10A fuse on 12V power input just to be on safe side, works with 14V+ voltages, but cleaner the voltage better. not tested on gasoline engines how spark affects yet.
